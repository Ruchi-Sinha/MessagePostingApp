# MessagePostingApp
A MEAN message posting app front end with authentication functionality. In the frontend, used Angularjs 1.6 and created own custom directives. Used ui-routers for states and routes. 

# Authentication
We authenticated our app using Satellizer package so that only authorized user can post in this app. Used jwt-simple package to create tokens and handled it in the front end.
